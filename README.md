# Soundsible

A cloud-first, self-hosted music platform that streams your own library from Cloudflare R2 / Backblaze B2 to any Linux device.

## Features

### Music Player 
- **Streaming playback**: Stream music directly from cloud storage 
- **Smart caching**: LRU cache with configurable size (default 50GB) 
- **Offline mode**: Play cached tracks without internet 
- **Multi-device sync**: Automatic library synchronization across devices 
- **GTK interface**: Native Linux desktop integration (GTK4/Adwaita) 
- **MPRIS integration**: Media key support (optional) 
- **Queue management**: Create and manage playback queues
- **Search/Filter**: In-app library search

### Setup Tool
- **Multi-provider support**: Choose between Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, or other S3-compatible services
- **Guided setup wizard**: Step-by-step account configuration and bucket creation
- **Automatic compression**: Convert lossless formats (FLAC/WAV) to MP3/OGG for efficient streaming
- **Deduplication**: Hash-based duplicate detection saves storage space
- **Parallel uploads**: Fast multi-threaded file uploads with progress tracking
- **QR code pairing**: Easy multi-device setup

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- ffmpeg (for audio conversion)
- **libmpv1** (required for music playback)
- **python-mpris-server** (optional, for media key support)

### System Packages

Install required system dependencies:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg libmpv1 python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 playerctl

# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-pip ffmpeg mpv-libs python3-gobject gtk4 libadwaita playerctl

# Arch
sudo pacman -S python-pip ffmpeg mpv python-gobject gtk4 libadwaita playerctl
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arzuparreta/soundsible.git
   cd soundsible
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   
   Then activate it:
   
   **Bash/Zsh:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Fish shell:**
   ```fish
   source venv/bin/activate.fish
   ```
   
   > **Note for Arch users:** Due to PEP 668, you must use a virtual environment for pip installations. Always activate the venv before installing Python packages.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Using the GUI App (Recommended)

The easiest way to use Soundsible is through the **GTK graphical application**:

```bash
./gui.sh
```

The GUI includes everything you need:
- 🎵 **Music Player** — Stream and play your library
- ⬇️ **Download & Push (Smart)** — Download music from Spotify/YouTube and upload to cloud *(Menu → Download & Push)*
- ⬆️ **Upload Local Files** — Upload local music files to cloud *(Menu → Upload Local Files)*
- ⚙️ **Setup Wizard** — Configure cloud storage credentials *(Menu → Setup Wizard)*
- 🎨 **Themes** — Choose between System, Light, Dark, or ODST themes

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, you'll be prompted to run the **Setup Wizard** to configure your cloud storage. This only needs to be done once.

### Optional: Enable Media Keys

For keyboard media control (play/pause/next/previous keys):

Activate your virtual environment first:

**Bash/Zsh:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Fish shell:**
```fish
source venv/bin/activate.fish
```

Then install MPRIS support:
```bash
pip install mpris-server
```

> **Arch users:** You can alternatively install from AUR: `yay -S python-mpris-server`

---

## ODST Tool: Music Downloader

The **ODST Tool** is a dedicated web interface for downloading music from Spotify, YouTube, or YouTube Music links. It downloads music in Soundsible compatible format and can sync directly to your cloud storage.

To use the ODST Tool:

```bash
cd odst_tool
./downloader_web.sh
```

Then open the displayed URL in your browser to access the download interface.

> **Note:** This is different from the GUI's "Download & Push" feature. ODST provides more advanced features including multi-platform link support, playlist selection, smart matching, and batch downloads.

For detailed setup instructions (Spotify API credentials for auto-downloading playlists, etc.), see **[odst_tool/README.md](odst_tool/README.md)**.

---

## Alternative: Upload via Web Interface

For uploading local files to your cloud library through a web browser:

```bash
./start_web.sh
```

Then open the displayed URL (usually `http://localhost:5000`) in your browser.

---

## Advanced: CLI/Terminal Player

For terminal-based playback:

```bash
# List all tracks
./player.sh list

# Start interactive player (TUI)
./player.sh play

# Play matching tracks
./player.sh play "Daft Punk"

# Download tracks for offline use
./player.sh download "Jazz"

# Check cache usage
./player.sh cache-status
```

---

## Advanced: Setup Tool CLI

For advanced configuration and batch uploads via command line:

### Initial Setup

Run the guided setup wizard:
```bash
python -m setup_tool.cli init --guided
```

The wizard will:
1. Help you choose a storage provider (Cloudflare R2 or Backblaze B2)
2. Guide you through account creation
3. Configure API credentials
4. Create your music bucket
5. Generate player configuration

### Upload Music

Upload your music library:
```bash
python -m setup_tool.cli upload /path/to/your/music --compress --parallel 4
```

Options:
- `--compress`: Automatically convert FLAC/WAV to MP3 (320kbps)
- `--parallel N`: Number of concurrent uploads (default: 4)

### Check Status

View your library status:
```bash
python -m setup_tool.cli status
```

### Multi-Device Setup

Export configuration for other devices:
```bash
python -m setup_tool.cli export-config --format qr
```

Scan the QR code on your other device to automatically configure the player.

## Storage Provider Comparison

| Provider | Free Tier | Bandwidth Cost | Credit Card Required | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Cloudflare R2** | 10GB | **FREE** (zero egress) | Yes | Streaming (recommended) |
| **Backblaze B2** | 10GB | $0.01/GB | No | Simple setup, backups |
| **AWS S3** | 5GB (12 months) | $0.09/GB | Yes | AWS ecosystem users |

**Recommendation**: Use Cloudflare R2 for zero bandwidth costs when streaming music.
