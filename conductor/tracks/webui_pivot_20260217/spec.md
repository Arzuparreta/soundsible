# Specification: WebUI Strategic Pivot

## 1. Objectives
- **Product Hierarchy**: Reposition WebUI as the flagship experience.
- **Legacy Support**: Maintain GTK app for specialized low-resource Linux environments.
- **UX Refinement**: "Cyber-Premium" haptics, precision gestures, and viewport-aware layouts.

## 2. Technical Scope

### WebUI Enhancements
- **Haptic Engine**: Centralized vibration controller with system-level respect.
- **Gesture Hardening**: `touchcancel` and `visibilitychange` handling for reliable iOS interaction.
- **Visual Polish**: Scaled labels, Omni-Island animations, and notch-safe layouts.

### Documentation
- **README Overhaul**: Rewrite to emphasize "Station" (WebUI) as the core product.

## 3. Success Criteria
- WebUI serves as the primary entry point for new users.
- Haptics feel native and precise on supported devices.
- GTK app remains functional but secondary.
