# Initial Concept

Soundsible is a modular, high-fidelity media platform designed to give you absolute control over your music library.

# Soundsible: The Universal Music Ecosystem

Soundsible is a high-fidelity, modular music platform designed for users seeking absolute data sovereignty and an uncompromised listening experience. It empowers users to transition away from proprietary streaming services by providing a sophisticated way to store, manage, and stream their personal music collections with audiophile-grade quality.

## Vision
To provide a resilient, "Home Station" centric ecosystem where users own their data, metadata, and playback experience, seamlessly bridging the gap between high-speed local storage and secure cloud accessibility.

## Core Values
- **Ownership & Sovereignty:** Absolute control over files and metadata; no external subscriptions or locked ecosystems.
- **Uncompromised Fidelity:** Ensuring bit-perfect delivery and high-resolution audio support (FLAC) across all interfaces.
- **Resilient Connectivity:** Intelligent path resolution (Connection Race) that automatically finds the fastest route (Local -> Cache -> Cloud) based on the user's environment.

## Target Audience
- Users abandoning proprietary services (Spotify, etc.) for local and self-hosted cloud solutions.
- Audiophiles demanding high-fidelity playback on both desktop and mobile.
- Power users with large NAS collections and multi-cloud storage strategies (R2, B2, S3).

## Strategic Focus
- **Primary Development:** WebUI Player (PWA). Elevating the mobile and browser experience to "high-end" native standards, focusing on fluid animations, tactile gestures, and robust functionality.
- **Legacy Support:** Maintaining the GTK/Adwaita Linux application as a high-performance option for low-end devices and native desktop integration.

## Key Challenges & Goals
- **UI Stability:** Fixing and refining the "Now Playing" view, transport controls, and action menus to ensure they are robust and responsive.
- **Tactile Polish:** Harmonizing "slime" and "magnetic" animation physics with a consistent, professional design language.
- **Metadata Harmony:** Aligning the UI organization (albums, artists) with the metadata generated by the internal downloader, the web-based ODST tool, and existing library scans.
