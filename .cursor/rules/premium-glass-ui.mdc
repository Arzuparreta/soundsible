# UI design standard (soundsible)

For any UI or frontend work in this project, follow the **premium-glass-ui-design** skill:

- **Location:** `.cursor/skills/premium-glass-ui-design/SKILL.md`
- **Use it for:** Layouts, components, styling, glass panels, typography, spacing, motion, and visual polish in `ui_web/`, `player/ui/`, or any frontend code.

Apply its principles (glassmorphism, clarity, spacing, motion) unless the user explicitly asks for a different style.
